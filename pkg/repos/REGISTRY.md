# Repository Registry

The repository registry is a repository where a registry.json document is stored and is locally downloaded  to the registry dir. The registry.json document contains a list of repositories. The registry.json document is used to search for repositories and to retrieve the git url of a repository.

The provided URL can then be used to install the repository to the repository cache.
